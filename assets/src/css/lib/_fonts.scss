/**
 * @info
 * Here, we outline all @font-face declarations
 * for the entire project.
 *
 * The font faces included here are for example only.
 * They should be replaced with the real font faces.
 *
 * Note: When you run "npm start", the css and javascript
 * are compiled locally and served to the browser without
 * being uploaded to Shopify's servers. We do this because
 * it dramatically speeds up the time between when the file
 * is saved and when the change appears in the browser. However,
 * in order to make this possible, we have a Webpack loader that
 * replaces the "asset_url" filter with the value of "path.cdn"
 * in the kit.config.js file. So, it is important to ensure that
 * this property in kit.config.js is the correct value.
 * When the theme is build and deployed, the Liquid filter
 * is interpreted by Shopify normally.
 *
 * Example of "path.cdn":
 * https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0234/4347/2480/t/25/assets/
